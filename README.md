# Space Invaders

## Description
This was my final project for my first computer science class. I used Python and the TKinter library to recreate a little portion of the old Space Invaders game. There is only one working level, but I only had a week to finish it. One of my favorite projects for a computer science class honestly. I went back at one point to fefactor this and make it better, but ultimately decided I should just learn C++ and graphics with that instead.

## Features
- Moveable player
- Textures players and enemies
- Shootable weapons for both player and enemeies
- Simple AI for enemies
- Co-op mode with 2nd player ship
- Highscores saving
- Some collision handling between the bullets / enemies, and enemies / players

## How to play
```sh
cd OLD/
python3 space_invaders.py
```
